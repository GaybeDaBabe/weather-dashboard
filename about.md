# About This Project

This Weather Dashboard is a front-end web application built as a final project for Web Applications class at Anderson University. The goal of the project is to demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive dashboard that retrieves real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features
- Search any city and view its current weather
- 5-day forecast using OpenWeather’s 3-hour interval data
- Dynamic DOM updates for weather information
- Recent search history saved using localStorage
- Responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- API key kept private using a separate `config.js` file (excluded via `.gitignore`)

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** — semantic structure for accessibility and clarity  
- **CSS3** — modern layout with grid, flexbox, CSS variables, and visual styling  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — functions, loops, DOM manipulation, fetch API  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** — current weather + 5-day forecast  
- **Git & GitHub** — version control, repository management
